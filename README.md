# FikaTogether

Welcome to the admistration portal repo of the Craft Academy, August 2021 cohort's final project. We have designed a fullstack application that encourages employees to take Fikas with employees from different departments, and different positions within a company, who would not normally mix. 

This was achieved by building an API that would match employees who are most dissimilar using a cosine similarity machine learning algorithm, which then interacts with the Google Calendar API to schedule a Fika between the employees. On the front end an information point admin portal was created to manage the Fikas and employees taking them.
